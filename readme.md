# Playwright
The intention is to learn Playwright. To get a new project setup from scratch, to get a PoC working, and document best practices. I have no prior experience with Playwright, and I have little experience writing UI Automation.

## About Playwright

### About This Repository
This repository will function as a template and starting place for new Playwright projects. It will also contain a Proof of Concept to outline how Playwright works, and will contain training material, and a best practice guide. 

Ideally all projects within the organization that are using Playwright follow the same setup and coding styles. This will allow people to move across projexts with minimal ramp up time, allow easier understanding of the automation, and allow people from across projects to help one another.
